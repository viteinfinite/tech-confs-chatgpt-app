Unlike business logic or UI issues, which can be caught by unit or manual tests, regressions in analytics tracking often remain unnoticed until someone creates a report half a year later.\n\nTo address this issue for my company, I've created a simple framework that identifies regressions in analytics events using XCUITests. The principle is straightforward: after implementing event tracking for a feature, we record the events triggered during related XCUITest run and store them into a JSON file. In future XCUITest runs, we compare triggered events with their parameters to the recorded snapshot and fail the test in case of unexpected changes.\n\nIn my talk, I plan to explain the core concept of this approach and provide technical details of its implementation. I consider them interesting for the audience as they include advanced usage of protocols, mirroring, and passing data between main app and UI tests.\nTo better illustrate the process, I will create a simple demo app and publish it on GitHub, allowing everyone to experiment with and possibly enhance it."},{"id":"b5f70c60-4236-559c-b002-9e3839db547b","title":"Streamlining iOS Development with Selective Testing","speakersPlainText":"Mike Gerasymenko","speakers":[{"id":"243564f0-ec6d-81e2-be36-d69bb259a030"}],"fromTime":"2025-10-07T11:55:00.000+02:00","toTime":"2025-10-07T12:10:00.000+02:00","kind":"Talk","abstract":"In this talk, I will delve into the concept of selective testing, showcasing XcodeSelectiveTesting.
